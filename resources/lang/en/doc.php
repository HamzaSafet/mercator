It has established itself as the benchmark planisphere in the world thanks to its precision for sea travel. It is not, stricto sensu, a central projection: the point of latitude φ is not sent, as one might expect, on a point of ordinate proportional to tan (φ) but on a point of ordinate proportional to ln [tan (φ / 2 + π / 4)].',
        'p4' => 'The Mercator projection is a conformal projection, that is, it preserves the angles. However, it has the effect of deformations on distances and areas. Indeed, a distortion increases as the distance from the equator towards the poles increases. A Mercator map cannot therefore cover the poles: they would be infinitely large. For example, this results in the vision of an equality of surface between Greenland and Africa when the latter is 14 times greater.',
